The aim of this project is to build a simple and interactive web application that allows users to search for real-time weather information for any city. It demonstrates practical skills in React, API integration, and front-end development.

Weather Finder is a React-based web application created using Vite. It fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the cityâ€™s temperature, weather conditions, and related information in a clean and user-friendly interface. Users can enter the name of any city, and the app will instantly provide the latest weather details. This project highlights practical usage of APIs, state management in React, and responsive UI design. It serves as a practical exercise in combining modern web technologies to solve real-world problems.
